# Random program that performs benfords law analysis using the go excelize library and fyne as the GUI

# What is it? How it works?
This program is just a benford's law calculator that uses an Excel Workbook as its number container.
Place numbers in an excel file in their own individual cells.

Run the program, select an excel file with data, it reads the excel file, then it calculates a benfords table and outputs the results into a new excel file with the results on a new sheet within the workbook.

!! This is a experiment/educational side project.

# To Do:
- Have a choice in which format to output the results. Currently outputs only as an xlsx file.
- Fine tweak it.

# GUI
