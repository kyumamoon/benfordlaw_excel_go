# Random program that uses the go excelize library and fyne as the GUI

# What is it? How it works?
This program is just a benford's law calculator that uses Excel as its number dumpster.
Place all you numbers in an excel file. Doesn't matter where numbers are placed in the cells as long as each number gets its own cell.

Run the program, it reads the excel file. Calculates a benfords table and outputs a new excel file with the results on a new sheet within the workbook.

!! This is a random side project. Wouldn't recommend using it on real data since the program is prone to bugs.

# To Do:
- Have a choice in which format to output the results. Currently outputs only as an xlsx file.
